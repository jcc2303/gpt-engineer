In the translated code, the `parseChat` function takes a `chat` string and returns an array of tuples representing the parsed files. 
The regular expression is used to find all code blocks enclosed in triple backticks ("```"). 
The `path` is extracted from the first line of each code block, and the code content is extracted from the remaining lines. 
The parsed file information is then added to the `files` array.

The `toFiles` function takes a chat string and a workspace object. 

It sets the `all_output.txt` key in the workspace object to the provided chat value. 

It then calls the `parseChat` function to get the files from the `chat` string and adds 
each `file` to the workspace object using the file name as the key and the file content as the value.

Please note that TypeScript's `RegExp` syntax is used instead of Python's `re` module. 

The `matchAll` method is used to iterate over all matches of the regular expression in the chat string.
