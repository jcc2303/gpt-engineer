In this updated code, we import the openai library for Node.js using the openai package. Make sure to install this package in your project using npm or yarn.

Please replace { /* API credentials and options */ } with the appropriate configuration for the openai client, including your API credentials and any other necessary options.

The code uses async/await syntax to handle asynchronous operations when making API calls to OpenAI. The next method is updated to use the await keyword when calling the chatCompletion.create method.

The npm command to install the OpenAI library for Node.js is:

`npm install @openai/api`

This command will install the `@openai/api` package from the npm registry and make it available for use in your Node.js project.

If you prefer to use Yarn, you can use the following command instead:

`yarn add @openai/api`
