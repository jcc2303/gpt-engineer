In the translated code, we use Node.js built-in modules `fs` and `path` for file system operations and path manipulation, respectively.

The `DB` class represents a simple key-value database. 

The constructor creates the specified directory path if it doesn't exist. 

The `getItem` method reads the content of a file given the key, and the `setItem` method writes the provided value to a file with the given key.

The DBs interface represents a collection of different databases, where each property corresponds to a specific database represented by the DB class.

Lastly, we create an instance of `DB` for each database within the `dbs` object, 
providing the respective paths for each database.
